# Portals - Agent context

## Project overview

**Official name**: Portals
**CLI command**: `docsync`

Multi-platform document synchronization tool that keeps local markdown files in sync with Notion, Google Docs, and Obsidian.

**Primary use case**: Mirror the entire `~/Documents/Claude Code/` directory to the Portals team space in Notion for work and business documentation.

**Created**: 2025-11-11
**Owner**: Roman Siepelmeyer
**Status**: Planning phase
**Notion team space**: Portals

## Core philosophy

### Database separation strategy

**Notion** = Work and business
- Claude Code projects
- Work documentation
- Structured, collaborative content
- Primary sync target

**Obsidian** = Personal knowledge base
- Self-reflection
- Book notes
- Personal insights
- Read-only import source

**No bidirectional sync needed** between Notion and Obsidian - they serve different purposes.

### Sync philosophy

- **Semi-automatic**: Prompt before syncing, don't sync silently
- **Manual conflict resolution**: Show diffs, let user decide
- **Local-first**: Local files are source of truth
- **Transparent**: Clear status and error messages

## Operating modes

DocSync has three distinct operating modes:

### 1. Mirror mode (Notion) - PRIMARY
Entire directory ↔ Notion workspace

**Use case**: Keep all Claude Code projects synced with Notion
**Characteristics**: Automatic pairing, hierarchical sync, always-on watch mode

### 2. Pair mode (Google Docs) - OCCASIONAL
Selective individual document pairing

**Use case**: Collaborate on specific documents via Google Docs
**Characteristics**: Manual pairing, on-demand sync, 5-10 documents max

### 3. Import mode (Obsidian) - ONE-WAY
Import from Obsidian vault for inspiration

**Use case**: Pull personal insights into work context
**Characteristics**: Read-only, no tracking, format conversion

---

## Implementation phases

**Current phase**: Phase 0 - Not started

### Phase breakdown

| Phase | Description | Duration | Priority |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|
| 0 | Foundation and project setup | 3-5 days | Required |
| 1 | Local file operations | 3-5 days | Required |
| 2 | Notion adapter | 5-7 days | Required |
| 3 | Mirror mode initialization | 3-4 days | Required |
| 4 | Bidirectional sync | 5-7 days | Required |
| 5 | Conflict resolution | 4-5 days | Required |
| 6 | Watch mode | 3-5 days | Required |
| 7 | Google Docs pairing | 3-5 days | Optional |
| 8 | Obsidian import | 2-3 days | Optional |

**MVP** (Phases 0-6): ~21-33 days
**Full implementation**: ~31-50 days

## How to use this project

### For development

1. Read `01-context/2025-11-11_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` thoroughly
2. Understand the three operating modes
3. Follow implementation phases sequentially
4. Each phase has clear acceptance criteria

### For understanding the codebase

1. Start with `docsync/core/models.py` - data structures
2. Then `docsync/adapters/base.py` - adapter interface
3. Then `docsync/core/sync_engine.py` - sync algorithm
4. Mode controllers tie everything together

### For using the tool (once built)

```bash
# Initialize mirror mode for Notion sync
cd ~/Documents/Claude\ Code/
docsync init notion-mirror --database=<database-id>
docsync watch

# Create selective Google Docs pair
docsync pair report.md gdoc://abc123
docsync sync report.md

# Import from Obsidian
docsync import obsidian://vault/note.md --to=notion://page-id
```

## Key architectural decisions

### 1. Why three modes instead of one generic tool?

Different workflows have fundamentally different characteristics:
- Mirror mode: Automatic, hierarchical, always-on
- Pair mode: Manual, selective, on-demand
- Import mode: One-way, no tracking

### 2. Why Notion as primary over Obsidian?

- Better API support (official SDK)
- Better collaboration features
- Web-based access
- Database and properties
- Aligns with user's natural usage (work/business)

### 3. Why semi-automatic instead of fully automatic?

- User wants control over syncs
- Manual conflict resolution is safer
- Prompts provide visibility
- Prevents accidental overwrites

### 4. Why local-first architecture?

- Local files are source of truth
- Works offline
- Git-friendly
- No vendor lock-in

### 5. Why 3-way merge?

- Most reliable conflict detection
- Tracks last synced state (base)
- Can differentiate scenarios accurately
- Industry standard (Git uses this)

---

## Open questions

Questions to resolve during implementation:

1. **Notion structure**: Database vs nested pages for folder hierarchy?
2. **Folder representation**: How to represent empty folders in Notion?
3. **Attachment handling**: Upload to Notion or keep local references?
4. **Metadata location**: Store Notion page ID in YAML front matter?
5. **Git integration**: Should `.docsync/` be committed?

---

## Success criteria

### Functional
- Successfully sync 50+ files in mirror mode
- Detect and resolve conflicts correctly
- Watch mode runs reliably for 24+ hours
- Zero data loss or corruption

### Performance
- Initial sync of 50 files in < 2 minutes
- Individual file sync in < 5 seconds
- Change detection in < 100ms

### Usability
- New user can set up in < 5 minutes
- Clear error messages
- Intuitive conflict resolution
